abstract: A mechanically alloyed austenitic stainless steel (MA304LZ) was
  produced from pre-alloyed SUS304L powder with 0.7% wt of Zr addition. The
  precipitates had a bimodal size distribution causing strengthening of MA304LZ
  with 3.3 times larger yield stress than SUS304L, although the contribution of
  fine grains of MA304LZ to the strengthening was larger than the dispersion of
  precipitates. For precipitate characterization, two types of extraction
  replica samples were produced; 1) Thin carbon film and 2) Electrochemically
  dissolved residue. Extraction replica residue was analyzed using XRD and both
  types were attached to copper grids for TEM, EDS, and EELS analysis. The
  previously reported Zr-rich precipitates were revealed to be ZrO2 (zirconia)
  with no evidence of ZrN or ZrC.
