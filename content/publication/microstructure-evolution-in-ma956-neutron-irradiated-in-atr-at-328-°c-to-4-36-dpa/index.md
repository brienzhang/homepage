abstract: "MA956 is an iron-chromium-aluminum (FeCrAl) based oxide dispersion
  strengthened (ODS) alloy produced by mechanical alloying. The alloy was
  irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at 328 \x14C up to 4.36 dpa with
  both thermal and fast neutrons. The microstructures before and after
  irradiation were investigated by various TEM techniques. The size and number
  density of dislocation loops, voids, and oxides were analyzed. The results
  showed that both 1/2\\textless111\\textgreater and \\textless100\\textgreater
  loops were generated in irradiated materials. The number density of
  dislocation loops reached up to 7.17 Â 1021/m3. Cavities/voids were formed
  during irradiation. Argon bubbles were observed in unirradiated materials
  attached to the surface of oxide particles. The swelling rate was estimated to
  be 0.08% without subtracting pre-existed Ar bubbles. The oxide particles could
  maintain crystal structure during irradiation. The oxides had small decrease
  in size but half reduction in number density after irradiation. Calculation
  estimated that \\textless100\\textgreater loops and dislocation lines
  contributed most to hardening. Alpha prime precipitates were suggested to be
  formed by comparing to the calculated hardening. Dislocation lines are
  demonstrated not forming tangles in irradiated specimens."
