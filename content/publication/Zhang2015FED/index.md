abstract: Ion-irradiation hardening of tungsten (W) before and after
  recrystallization was investigated in this paper. Three specimens were sampled
  from a rolled pure (99.95%) W plate. Two are from the as-received W and one
  was from the recrystallized W (annealed at 1400 ◦C for 1 h). Specimens were
  irradiated with 6.4 MeV Fe3+ at 300 ◦C, 700 ◦C and 1000 ◦C, respectively. The
  proﬁle of displacement per atom (dpa) calculated by SRIM showed the average
  displacement damage is about 2 dpa at the depth of 600 nm. The hardness of
  irradiated area was measured by nano-indentation method with continuous
  stiffness measurement (CSM) and was calculated by Nix–Gao model for
  bulk-equivalent hardness. Irradiation hardening was deﬁned as the difference
  between the hardness values of irradiated area and unirradiated area of a
  specimen. The result revealed that recrystallized specimens exhibited larger
  irradiation harden- ng than the as-received ones, and the amount of hardening
  was independent of irradiation temperature, while the hardening of as-received
  W increased with increasing irradiation temperature. There was no difference
  in the irradiation hardening between the specimens sampled from the different
  sides of the as-received W.
