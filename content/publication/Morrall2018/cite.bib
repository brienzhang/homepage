 abstract = {A mechanically alloyed austenitic stainless steel (MA304LZ) was produced from pre-alloyed SUS304L powder with 0.7% wt of Zr addition. The precipitates had a bimodal size distribution causing strengthening of MA304LZ with 3.3 times larger yield stress than SUS304L, although the contribution of fine grains of MA304LZ to the strengthening was larger than the dispersion of precipitates. For precipitate characterization, two types of extraction replica samples were produced; 1) Thin carbon film and 2) Electrochemically dissolved residue. Extraction replica residue was analyzed using XRD and both types were attached to copper grids for TEM, EDS, and EELS analysis. The previously reported Zr-rich precipitates were revealed to be ZrO2 (zirconia) with no evidence of ZrN or ZrC.},
