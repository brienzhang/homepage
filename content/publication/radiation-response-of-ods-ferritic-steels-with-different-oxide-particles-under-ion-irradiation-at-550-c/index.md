abstract: "In order to investigate the effects of oxide particles on radiation
  response such as hardness change and microstructural evolution, three types of
  oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels (named Y-TiODS, Y-Al-ODS
  and Y-Al-Zr-ODS), mostly strengthened by Y-Ti-O, Y-Al-O and Y-Zr-O
  dispersoids, respectively, were simultaneously irradiated with iron and helium
  ions at 550 \x14C up to a damage of 30 dpa and a corresponding helium (He)
  concentration of ~3500 appm to a depth of 1000e1300 nm. A single iron ion beam
  irradiation was also performed for reference. Transmission electron microscopy
  revealed that after the dual ion irradiation helium bubbles of 2.8, 6.6 and
  4.5 nm in mean diameter with the corresponding number densities of 1.1 Â 1023,
  2.7 Â 1022 and 3.6 Â 1022 mÀ3 were observed in Y-TiODS, Y-Al-ODS and
  Y-Al-Zr-ODS, respectively, while no such bubbles were observed after single
  ion irradiation. About 80% of intragranular He bubbles were adjacent to oxide
  particles in the ODS ferritic steels. Although the high number density He
  bubbles were observed in the ODS steels, the void swelling in Y-Ti-ODS,
  Y-Al-ODS and Y-Al-Zr-ODS was still small and estimated to be 0.13%, 0.53% and
  0.20%, respectively. The excellent swelling resistance is dominantly
  attributed to the high sink strength of oxide particles that depends on the
  morphology of particle dispersion rather than the crystal structure of the
  particles. In contrast, no dislocation loops were produced in any of the
  irradiated steels. Nanoindentation measurements showed that no irradiation
  hardening but softening was found in the ODS ferritic steels, which was
  probably due to irradiation induced dislocation recovery. The helium bubbles
  in high number density never contributed to the irradiation hardening of the
  ODS steels at these irradiation conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights
