 abstract = {Dissimilar joints of ODS ferritic steel and RAFM steel F82H would be required for the construction of advanced blankets to increase the exible design margin and get the benets from each material in a functional way. The welding parameter determines the formation of joint, the generation of welding defect and the microstructure of the joint. This study aims to achieve the defect-free joint by optimizing the welding parameters in dissimilar friction stir welding of the ODS and F82H steels. Four different welding conditions were applied to the welding processes, and the corresponding effects on defects and microstructures were investigated. Results show that neither the δ ferrite nor inter-metallic compound can be generated in the FSW joint of F82H and ODS steels. In order to achieve the defect-free joint and to prevent the stir tool from breaking, the “softer material” F82H should be arranged on the retreating side and the stir tool should be plugged into the F82H side.},
