abstract: Pure tungsten (W) single crystals of \0 0 1\ and \0 1 1\ surface
  orientations were irradiated with 6.4 MeV Fe3+ ions up to 1 dpa at 573 K. The
  TEM examination revealed that there was a very small orientation dependence in
  the radiation damaged microstructure, showing that both W\0 0 1\ and W\0 1 1\
  exhibited a double black band structure with high number density of
  dislocation loop rafts in the black bands. However, the depth proﬁle of
  ion-irradiation hardening evaluated by nanoindentation (NI) technique turned
  out to show a clear orientation dependence, namely, W\0 0 1\ showed a deeper
  NI hardness proﬁle than W\0 1 1\.
