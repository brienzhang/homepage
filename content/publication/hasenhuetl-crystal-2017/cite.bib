 abstract = {Pure tungsten (W) single crystals of \0 0 1\ and \0 1 1\ surface orientations were irradiated with 6.4 MeV Fe3+ ions up to 1 dpa at 573 K. The TEM examination revealed that there was a very small orientation dependence in the radiation damaged microstructure, showing that both W\0 0 1\ and W\0 1 1\ exhibited a double black band structure with high number density of dislocation loop rafts in the black bands. However, the depth proﬁle of ion-irradiation hardening evaluated by nanoindentation (NI) technique turned out to show a clear orientation dependence, namely, W\0 0 1\ showed a deeper NI hardness proﬁle than W\0 1 1\.},
