abstract: "Tungsten (W) has been selected as the armor materials for divertor in
  fusion reactors. To investigate the temperature dependent microstructural
  evolution under fusion relevant environment, pure W was irradiated with dual
  beam of 6.4 MeV Fe3þ and 1 MeV energy degraded Heþ at 300 \x14C, 500 \x14C,
  700 \x14C and 1000 \x14C. The overall distribution of microstructures were
  observed. At 300 \x14C, a high dislocation density zone (HDDZ) appeared at the
  end of radiation area. The HDDZ gradually disappeared with increasing
  irradiation temperature, instead, a low dislocation density zone (LDDZ)
  appeared between the front zone (FZ) and diffusion zone (DZ). At all the
  irradiation temperatures, both dislocation lines and loops were observed,
  while bubbles were observed only at 500 \x14C and above. Loop rafts appeared
  in the whole irradiated area from 300 \x14C to 700 \x14C, but only in the
  defect diffusion zone (DZ) at 1000 \x14C. Dislocation loop denuded zone was
  formed along grain boundaries, suggesting that grain boundaries suppress the
  formation of dislocation loops. Bubbles at grain boundaries tended to have a
  larger size than those in the matrix, indicating that bubble growth was
  accelerated in grain boundaries."

summary: "pure W was irradiated with dual beam of 6.4 MeV Fe3+ and 1 MeV energy
  degraded He+ at 300C, 500C, 700C and 1000C. The overall distribution of
