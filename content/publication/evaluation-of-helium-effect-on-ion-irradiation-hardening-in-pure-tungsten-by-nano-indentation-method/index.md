abstract: "As-received and recrystallized pure tungsten (W) were irradiated with
  6.4 MeV Fe 3 + up to 2 dpa with or without He + at 300 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C and
  1000 °C respectively. Irradiation hardening was measured by the
  nano-indentation method. An equation to evaluate the bulk equivalent hardness
  was derived on the assumption that the geometrically necessary dislocation
  (GND) densities at an indentation depth were the same before and after
  irradiation. Ion-irradiation always induces hardening in both as-received and
  recrystallized W at all the experiment temperatures. In the case of
  single-beam irradiation, the recrystallized W exhibited higher hardening than
  as-received one. The effect of helium on the irradiation hardening is
  dependent on the material condition: as-received W showed an additional
  hardening by helium at all the irradiation temperatures, while in
  recrystallized W the hardening was not affected by helium below 700 °C."
