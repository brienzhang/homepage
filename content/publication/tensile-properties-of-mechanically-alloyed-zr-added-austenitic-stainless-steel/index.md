abstract: A mechanically alloyed austenitic stainless steel (MA304LZ) was
  produced from pre-alloyed SUS304L powder with a small amount of Zr addition.
  The yield stress of MA304LZ was more than 3 times larger than that of SUS304L
  or 316L, while total elongation was reduced to about one third of the
  conventional steels. Microstructure analysis revealed an average grain size of
  0.42 µm in MA304LZ and about 34/30 µm in SUS304L/ 316 L. In MA304LZ, two types
  of precipitates were observed; inhomogeneously distributed ﬁne precipitates
  with an average size of 6.0 nm and homogeneously distributed coarse
  precipitates (d \textgreater 20 nm) with an average size of 47 nm. The
  strengthening mechanism of MA304LZ was discussed on the bases of Hall-Petch
  and Orowan equations, and the strengthening of MA304LZ was attributed mostly
  to reﬁned grains. The dislocation barrier strength factor, α, is estimated to
  be 0.277 for the Zr-rich precipitates in MA304LZ.
