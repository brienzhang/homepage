title: TEM
subtitle: STEM imaging of dislocations in metal and alloy
summary: TEM is a powerful tool to investigate the microstructure in 
materials with high resolution and spectrum analysis methods. This 
project seeks to develope state-of-art methods such as STEM strain 
contrast imaging, 4D-STEM, in-situ TEM and so on, to facilitate the 
investigations of irradiation in nuclear materials.
