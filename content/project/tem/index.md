TEM is a powerful tool to investigate the microstructure in materials with high resolution and spectrum analysis methods. This project seeks to develope state-of-art methods such as STEM strain contrast imaging, 4D-STEM, in-situ TEM and so on, to facilitate the investigations of irradiation in nuclear materials.
STEM imaging, for its high intensity of electron beam and high resolution, have some special adavantages in imaging strain contrast such as dislocations. The strong beam allows a much thicker specimen than for conventional TEM imaging method. The specimen could be as thick as 150nm for iron based alloys. Thus, the defect spacing distribution could be investigated in thick specimens which has a large volumn to show as many defects as it can.

The strain contrast under STEM is compared to conventional TEM method under two beam condition. The STEM has a good image quality when incident angle is pretty small. However, a minimum g vector in STEM imaging is required. Analysis showed that at least 2g is required to avoid the influence of other excited diffraction patterns.

A programme is written to precisely control the tilting under STEM imaging. This programme is called Nezha. It will not only calculate the tilting for a special kikuchi line, but also will draw the pole projection of the reciprocal lattice.
