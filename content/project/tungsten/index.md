Tungsten has been chosen as the armor material for the divertor in the International Thermal Experimental Reactor (ITER) and potential candidate for the first wall in future electricity producing reactors like Demonstration Power Plant (DEMO), because of  its highest melting point, low sputtering, small tritium retention and pleasant thermal conductivity. During the operation, the armor will experience heavy heat load as well as neutron irradiation and helium trash implantation. Swelling and embrittlement were therefore occurred in the materials dependent on the irradiation conditions such as temperature. The material behavior under irradiation at different temperatures is key issue for the researches on tungsten.

As a function material, tungsten was not designed for its mechanical property. However it still need to be “strong” enough to survive in the extreme operating condition. The main issues for tungsten that researchers are investigating focus on the resistance to (1) high heat load, which will cause surface recrystallization, melting, and generating cracks, (2) helium embrittlement, as the helium trash could accumulate along the grain boundaries and cause intergranular embrittlement, as well as swelling and surface roughening, (3) irradiation embrittlement, which could be partially reflected by DBTT, that will refine the operation temperature of the divertor. 

Tungsten for diverter in ITER will obtain 0.5 dpa of yearly neutron damage. For DEMO, the value is 20. Helium transmutation in tungsten is very low (< 1appm/dpa) \[18]. However, most helium in tungsten are the trashes extracted from plasma. The transmutation produced by helium does not exceed 35 appm in tungsten. In DEMO, the concentration of helium in tungsten is considered to be less than 15 appm in divertor and about 25 appm in first wall after 3 year operation.

Not only the mechanical property on engineering but also the fundamental material behavior under irradiation are necessary to investigate. So far, the investigations on tungsten are still insufficient, especially the details of (1) microstructure evolution and their relation to irradiation hardening and (2) the material behaviour at high temperature (>800C). Therefore, the experiment were done in the thesis to understand the hardening and microstructure evolution at different temperatures, and the helium effect on the above issues.
