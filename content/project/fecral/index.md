Accident tolerant fuel (ATF) cladding has been proposed to enhance the safety of light water reactors (LWR) under design-basis and beyond-design-basis accident scenarios, aiming to delay the onset of detrimental oxidation and chemical interaction processes, reduce the reaction heat, lower the temperature rise, and resultantly minimize the potential for off-site radioactive releases.

The FeCrAl ODS steels are considered as the most promising candidate with both the excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at high temperatures. The dispersed oxides in FeCrAl ODS steels will not only function as barriers to dislocation motion and grain boundary migration to enhance the creep and fatigue resistance over a wide temperature range, but enhance the irradiation resistance by offering a number of annihilation sites for irradiation-induced damage structures at the particle-matrix interfaces, and trap the transmutation helium (He) into fine and less harmful bubbles.
The main issue that the FeCrAl steels are facing in reactor irradiation environment is the irradiation embrittlement which shifts the ductile brittle transition temperature (DBTT) greatly over room temperature. This degradation is related to the microstructure evolution such as voids, dislocation loops and precipitates.

Concentration related microstructure evolution under irradiation are two-fold. First, the radiation induced segregation (RIS) will occur through ballistic mixing and thermal spike mixing which will help second phase nucleation and the generated vacancies will accelerate the phase decompose progress. A typical phenomenon is the flux dependent alpha prime formation under neutron or ion irradiations in high Cr steels. Second, different concentrations could lead to formation of oxides with different structures, which will exhibit different tolerance to irradiation. This tolerance is heavily affected by irradiation temperature, where the oxides could be dissolved, amorphized and expanded depending on the back diffusion of knocked out atoms. The change of microstructures will result in irradiation hardening or softening, particularly the hardening will usually accompany with ductility reduction. 

Aging embrittlement is also an important issue in the high Cr steels. At elevated temperatures, Cr-enriched alpha prime and Al-enriched beta prime will precipiate. This precipitation is highly related to the concentration of Cr and Al. A series of FeCrAl ODS steels with different Cr and Al are produced by mechanical alloying methods. The steels are aged at 475°C for over 10000hrs. The aging hardening, precipitation kinetics, ductility reduction are investigated. The simulated tubing processing was also performed to produce 3mm-thick thin plates. The difference between as-extruded steels and simulated tubing processed steels arecompared.

The facilities used in this project include:
- DuET (ion-irradiation)
- FIB
- EBSD
- TEM
- Tensile machine
- Vickers hardness
- nanoindentation

Modeling and simulation are necessary by:
- molecular dynamics (LAMMPS)
- FEM (Abaqus)
