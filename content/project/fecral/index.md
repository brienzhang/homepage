Accident tolerant fuel (ATF) cladding has been proposed to enhance the safety of light water reactors (LWR) under design-basis and beyond-design-basis accident scenarios, aiming to delay the onset of detrimental oxidation and chemical interaction processes, reduce the reaction heat, lower the temperature rise, and resultantly minimize the potential for off-site radioactive releases. 
The FeCrAl ODS steels are considered as the most promising candidate with both the excellent mechanical properties and good oxidation resistance at high temperatures. The dispersed oxides in FeCrAl ODS steels will not only function as barriers to dislocation motion and grain boundary migration to enhance the creep and fatigue resistance over a wide temperature range, but enhance the irradiation resistance by offering a number of annihilation sites for irradiation-induced damage structures at the particle-matrix interfaces, and trap the transmutation helium (He) into fine and less harmful bubbles.
The issue for FeCrAl ferritic steels development is the optimization of the concentration of their solute element Cr and Al.
