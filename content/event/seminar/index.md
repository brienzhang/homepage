  STEM imaging of dislocations is a new topic recently discussed by several
  papers.Advantages of STEM imaging includes: 1) Less orientation sensitive->
  bend contour. 2) Strong beam intensity -> thicker specimen available. 3) Large
  scanning area. 4) High resolution  (weak beam, Yoshida et al.).
  The objective: 
  1) Examine the capability of TITAN to perform STEM dislocation imaging 
  2) Compare the STEM contrast under different deviation parameter and g vector 
  3) Compare the STEM and cTEM contrast 
  4) Check the deviation between dislocation imaging and real position.
