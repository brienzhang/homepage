The welding parameter determines the formation of joint, the generation of welding defect and the microstructure of the joint. This study aims to achieve the defect-free joint by optimizing the welding parameters in dissimilar friction stir welding of the ODS and F82H steels. Four different welding conditions were applied to the welding processes, and the corresponding effects on defects and microstructures were investigated. Results show that neither the δ ferrite nor inter-metallic compound can be generated in the FSW joint of F82H and ODS steels. In order to achieve the defect-free joint and to prevent the stir tool from breaking, the “softer material” F82H should be arranged on the retreating side and the stir tool should be plugged into the F82H side.},

For precipitate characterization, two types of extraction replica samples were produced; 1) Thin carbon film and 2) Electrochemically dissolved residue. Extraction replica residue was analyzed using XRD and both types were attached to copper grids for TEM, EDS, and EELS analysis.

Microstructure analysis revealed an average grain size of 0.42 µm in MA304LZ and about 34/30 µm in SUS304L/ 316 L. In MA304LZ, two types of precipitates were observed; inhomogeneously distributed ﬁne precipitates with an average size of 6.0 nm and homogeneously distributed coarse precipitates (d {\textgreater} 20 nm) with an average size of 47 nm. The strengthening mechanism of MA304LZ was discussed on the bases of Hall-Petch and Orowan equations, and the strengthening of MA304LZ was attributed mostly to reﬁned grains. The dislocation barrier strength factor, α, is estimated to be 0.277 for the Zr-rich precipitates in MA304LZ.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of oxide particles on radiation response such as hardness change and microstructural evolution, three types of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels (named Y-TiODS, Y-Al-ODS and Y-Al-Zr-ODS), mostly strengthened by Y-Ti-O, Y-Al-O and Y-Zr-O dispersoids, respectively, were simultaneously irradiated with iron and helium ions at 550 C up to a damage of 30 dpa and a corresponding helium (He) concentration of {\textasciitilde}3500 appm to a depth of 1000e1300 nm. A single iron ion beam irradiation was also performed for reference. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that after the dual ion irradiation helium bubbles of 2.8, 6.6 and 4.5 nm in mean diameter with the corresponding number densities of 1.1 Â 1023, 2.7 Â 1022 and 3.6 Â 1022 mÀ3 were observed in Y-TiODS, Y-Al-ODS and Y-Al-Zr-ODS, respectively, while no such bubbles were observed after single ion irradiation. About 80\% of intragranular He bubbles were adjacent to oxide particles in the ODS ferritic steels. Although the high number density He bubbles were observed in the ODS steels, the void swelling in Y-Ti-ODS, Y-Al-ODS and Y-Al-Zr-ODS was still small and estimated to be 0.13\%, 0.53\% and 0.20\%, respectively. The excellent swelling resistance is dominantly attributed to the high sink strength of oxide particles that depends on the morphology of particle dispersion rather than the crystal structure of the particles. In contrast, no dislocation loops were produced in any of the irradiated steels. Nanoindentation measurements showed that no irradiation hardening but softening was found in the ODS ferritic steels, which was probably due to irradiation induced dislocation recovery. The helium bubbles in high number density never contributed to the irradiation hardening of the ODS steels at these irradiation conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The overall distribution of microstructures were observed. At 300 C, a high dislocation density zone (HDDZ) appeared at the end of radiation area. The HDDZ gradually disappeared with increasing irradiation temperature, instead, a low dislocation density zone (LDDZ) appeared between the front zone (FZ) and diffusion zone (DZ). At all the irradiation temperatures, both dislocation lines and loops were observed, while bubbles were observed only at 500 C and above. Loop rafts appeared in the whole irradiated area from 300 C to 700 C, but only in the defect diffusion zone (DZ) at 1000 C. Dislocation loop denuded zone was formed along grain boundaries, suggesting that grain boundaries suppress the formation of dislocation loops. Bubbles at grain boundaries tended to have a larger size than those in the matrix, indicating that bubble growth was accelerated in grain boundaries.},

The alloy was irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at 328 C up to 4.36 dpa with both thermal and fast neutrons. The microstructures before and after irradiation were investigated by various TEM techniques. The size and number density of dislocation loops, voids, and oxides were analyzed. The results showed that both 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} and {\textless}100{\textgreater} loops were generated in irradiated materials. The number density of dislocation loops reached up to 7.17 Â 1021/m3. Cavities/voids were formed during irradiation. Argon bubbles were observed in unirradiated materials attached to the surface of oxide particles. The swelling rate was estimated to be 0.08\% without subtracting pre-existed Ar bubbles. The oxide particles could maintain crystal structure during irradiation. The oxides had small decrease in size but half reduction in number density after irradiation. Calculation estimated that {\textless}100{\textgreater} loops and dislocation lines contributed most to hardening. Alpha prime precipitates were suggested to be formed by comparing to the calculated hardening. Dislocation lines are demonstrated not forming tangles in irradiated specimens.},
